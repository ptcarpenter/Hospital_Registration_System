# Hospital_Registration_System

Designed an application which uses a singly linked list to manage patient registrations for an A&E department and exports a full record of all patients that have been treated to an SQL database. All functionality is contained within a simple menu interface which can be accessed in the Main.py file. This includes options to add patients to the waiting list, triage patients and assigned priority scores, treat patients with the highest priority scores and display all patients in the waiting list.
